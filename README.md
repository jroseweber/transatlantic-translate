 Like Google translate, but worse
 
 If you want to add words, there are a few rules.
 
 I didn't bother to add in an exception for words ending in y and their plurals, so you have to put fry and fries.
 
 If your word has a space in it, remove the space, before putting it into the list, and run spaceRemoval(your word with spaces) on it.
 
 If you mess up the index, the last word is psycoanalyze/psycoanalyse, for reference.
 
 P.S. It is total spaghetti code, so be warned if you try and alter it.
